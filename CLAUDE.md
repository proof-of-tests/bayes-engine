# Claude Code Instructions

This file contains instructions and context for Claude Code when working on this project.

## Project Context

This is the bayes-engine project, focused on Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming.

## Key Documents

For comprehensive development guidelines, see:

@AGENTS.md

## Quick Start for Claude

When working on this project:

1. **Review AGENTS.md first** - It contains the complete development workflow, code standards, and best practices
2. **Follow the branch naming conventions** - Use `<type>/<description>` format (feat/, fix/, docs/, etc.)
3. **Use Conventional Commits** - Format commit messages as `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
4. **Test thoroughly** - Write and run tests for any new functionality
5. **Keep commits focused** - Make small, logical commits with clear messages
6. **Update documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code changes

## Project-Specific Considerations

- This is a new project - help establish good patterns from the start
- License: Public domain (Unlicense)
- Emphasize clarity and correctness in probabilistic code
- Document assumptions and mathematical foundations

## Additional Context

The @ symbol in this document references other markdown files in the repository. When you see @AGENTS.md, refer to the AGENTS.md file in the repository for detailed information.

## Working with Claude Code

### Tools to Use

- **TodoWrite**: Use for multi-step tasks to track progress
- **Read**: Always read files before editing
- **Edit**: Prefer editing over rewriting when possible
- **Bash**: For git operations, testing, and builds
- **AskUserQuestion**: When requirements are unclear

### Best Practices

- Read AGENTS.md for the complete development workflow
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write clear commit messages using Conventional Commits format
- Test changes before committing
- Keep the user informed of progress with todo lists
